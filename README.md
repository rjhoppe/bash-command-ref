# bash-command-ref
A list of some helpful commands to remember when I write bash

Reverse search for previous bash commands in your terminal history.
```
Ctrl+R
```

Run "Fixed Command" (fc) after running an incorrect command to open up the previous command in a text editor.
```
fc
^xe
```

Pronounced "bang bang" (!!), this command will take the previous command and substitute it for the "!!"
A good example of when to use this is when you forget to preface a command with sudo.
```
!!
sudo !!
```
